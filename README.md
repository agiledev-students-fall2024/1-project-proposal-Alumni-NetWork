Alumni NetWork

**What and why?**
Alumni NetWork is a social mobile app that is built to enhance the frictions of alumni networking. The current prevailing way of reaching out to an alumni in the professional field includes 1. Find the company you might want to join. 2. Filter the school to find your alumni. 3. Guessing their work email so that you can send them a message.

Problems: 1. Their work emails aren't easy to guess and most of the time, alumnis don't feel comfortable putting their personal email in LinkedIn. 2. Filtering for alumnis at each firm becomes very repetitive. 3. Lack of a sense of community as an alumni is bombarded by emails from everyone.

Recognizing this networking friction, I propose an interactive mobile app that is school based to increase interactions between students and alumni professionals. For example, NYU students would be able to see a list of all NYU alumnis organized by the fields they are in. Each alumni's profile contains picture, description, and an ability to send a chat message or email.  

A secondary goal of this app is for alumnis to maintain a strong network between their graduating class as well. It will be a centralized app that shows reunion events rather than the occassional emails that alumnis get.

**For whom?**
For both current students and alumnis at universities. The main goal of this application is to bolster student-alumni interactions. A secondary goal is to increase a sense of community among the graduating classes.

**How?**
All students and alumnis would have their own profiles and because it is a school based app, NYU students will only see profiles from NYU. 

1. Chat messaging allowed to foster communications between student and alumni.
2. Calendar feastures to facilitate scheduling of coffee chats.

**Scope**
This is a doable project for a group of 4-6 programmers in one semester. The bulk of the work would include building out the structure of this social app and making it functional to allow user sign up. The second phase would be to advertise it among NYU students to increase profiles and usage.
